# Vector-Mechanics-For-Engineers-Computational-Problems-Series
A series of programs on the computation problems given in the book "Vector Mechanics for Engineers - Static and Dynamics" by Ferdinand Beer, E. Rusell Johnston, Elliot Eisenberg, Philip Cornwell and David Mazurek
# Implementation and design
Each problems is dive down into a function or set of functions for a computing the desired calculations. It is advisable to read each file documentation before using the functions for proper input and output system.
